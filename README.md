# Html-CSS-Landing-Page-Challenge-by-Frontend-Mentor

Hello, so there is a newbie html css challenge of making a pretty simple landing page from frontend mentor. I designed the website for mobile view first, and then added a media query for desktop design.
One thing more, I was not getting the same social media icons as they were in design, so I kinda messed them too to adjust with design, and surpringly it worked.
Rest is very simple padding and margin game, so I don't think i have to explain that.
I designed everything according to design provided, yet I think my css code is bit messy. 
I mean it could be more clean, like a professional!
